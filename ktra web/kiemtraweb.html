                                <h1>Levi Ackerman</h1>
                                <p>Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut, as well as narrow,
                                    intimidating dull gray eyes with dark circles under them and a deceptively youthful
                                    face. He is quite short, but his physique is well-developed in musculature from
                                    extensive vertical maneuvering equipment usage. He is usually either frowning or
                                    expressionless; that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, often makes it difficult for
                                    others to guess what he is thinking. He is most often seen in his Survey Corps
                                    uniform, with a light gray button up shirt underneath along with his trademark white
                                    ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears the Survey
                                    Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when forced to take leave from his duties due to
                                    injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt, ascot, and dress
                                    shoes.[citation needed] However, since the beginning of the coup d'état, he has left
                                    the ascot off. For most of the time during which the Survey Corps were on the run
                                    from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical maneuvering equipment
                                    harness over casual clothes.[citation needed]</p>
